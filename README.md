# Weather App

I'm thrilled to introduce my latest creation, a Weather App built with Flutter! This project has been an incredible journey, and I'm excited to share some of its key features:

## 1-Weather API Integration:
I utilized a robust weather API to fetch real-time weather data, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information for users.

## 2-State Management with Bloc and Cubit:
To manage the app's state efficiently, I implemented the Bloc and Cubit patterns, ensuring smooth and responsive user experiences

## 
This project not only enhanced my skills in Flutter development but also provided a deep dive into effective state management and API integration
